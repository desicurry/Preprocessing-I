    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently studying to be a Full Stack Web Developer at Lambda School where I have learned more then the basics. I decided to become a software engineer to challenge myself and prove my determination. While in Lambda School I learned to implement HTML, CSS, JS and more to create a website. I have also sharpened my problem solving skills and work well with others. When I'm not working one websites I am in my studio creating music. I currently have my own production compwny that is up and coming. If it wasn't for my time management skills I would be lost.</p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>Loooking back at my work experience I would say that I have about 15 years of sales experience. While working at my most recent sales position at Best Buy I was able to go back to school and receive my Bachelor's Degree in Business Management where I graduated with a 3.7 gpa. Unfortunately in 2016 I suffered a stroke and have been on disability ever since. With my determination I was able to build my strength up and prepare myself to get back into the work force.</p>
